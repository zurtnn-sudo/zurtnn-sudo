# 👋 Hi, I'm Zurt

Hey — welcome to my GitHub.

I'm a **Software Developer** who enjoys building clean, scalable systems and learning how things work under the hood. I care a lot about **good architecture**, **maintainable code**, and solving real problems instead of just shipping features fast.

Most of the projects here reflect my experience with:
- Backend & API development
- Cloud-native systems
- Serverless and distributed architectures
- Automation, data handling, and performance-focused design

---

## 🚀 What I Work With

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript / TypeScript
- **Backend:** REST APIs, event-driven systems, microservices
- **Cloud & DevOps:** AWS, Serverless, Infrastructure as Code
- **Databases:** SQL & NoSQL
- **Tools:** Docker, CI/CD, Git

## 🧠 How I Think About Engineering

I believe good software:
- Is **simple before clever**
- Is easy to read and reason about
- Scales both **technically and organizationally**
- Is built with long-term maintenance in mind

I enjoy improving systems gradually — better performance, cleaner abstractions, fewer surprises.
